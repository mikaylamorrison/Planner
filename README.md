# Planner

Hi! This here is a little project of mine that I built in a workshop hosted by MLH during Global Hack Week. This project was for me to become familiar with new languages (HTML, SQL, JavaScript, new aspects of Python) and to understand how I can use multiple languages to build the front-end and back-end for a single project. While I know basic implementation of OOP and some basic commands/problem solving in Java and Python, I wanted to be able to apply my skills to build something practical. 

Additionally, I wanted to know exactly what separates back-end development from front-end development. What sorts of tools do we need to implement from each end, what kinds of languages are most appropriate to use for each end? I also had some more general questions, such as what separates well-defined and efficient code from un-defined and inefficient code, how can we put OOP to use when using multiple languages? Ultimately, this project was a way or me to discover the answer to all my questions while also being able to learn even more than I thought I would. 

Languages Used: Javascript, CSS, HTML. Python, Flask. 

Topics/Skills: 
- Setting Up Python Coding Environments
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete; manages data in full-stack application)
- Routing
- Databases
- API
- Authenticate User Accounts

So why a hack planner? Most hackathons extend over the course of 48 hours, leaving hackers with little time to generate an idea and create a full-scale project. Due to such limited time the organization and delegation of tasks is a vital part of the challenge, and yet many groups struggle to create an effective method of documentation for their goals and ideas. To document group goals, keep track of progress, assign tasks, and ultimately relieve pressure on all members, hackers need to have an effective system of documentation. That's why this hack planner exists! 

Challenges?

Future?
